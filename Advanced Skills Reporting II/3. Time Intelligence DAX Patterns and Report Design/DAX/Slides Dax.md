Hereâ€™s a list of bullet points for a 10-slide presentation on understanding DAX functions:

### Slide 1: **Introduction to DAX**
- Definition: Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a formula language used in Power BI, Excel, and SQL Server Analysis Services.
- Purpose: DAX allows users to create calculations and manipulate data in reports and dashboards.

### Slide 2: **Why DAX is Important**
- Enables complex data modeling and analysis.
- Enhances Power BI, Power Pivot, and SSAS capabilities.
- Helps in deriving new insights from data by creating measures, calculated columns, and tables.

### Slide 3: **Basic Syntax of DAX**
- Operates on tables and columns, not cells.
- Functions return a table or scalar value.
- Key components: functions, operators, and expressions.

### Slide 4: **Common DAX Functions**
- **SUM**: Adds all values in a column.
- **AVERAGE**: Calculates the average of values.
- **COUNT**: Counts the number of rows.
- **MAX/MIN**: Returns the maximum or minimum value in a column.

### Slide 5: **Logical DAX Functions**
- **IF**: Performs conditional evaluations.
- **AND/OR**: Combines multiple conditions.
- **SWITCH**: Evaluates an expression against a list of values and returns the first match.

### Slide 6: **Time Intelligence Functions**
- **DATEADD**: Shifts dates back/forward in time (e.g., months, years).
- **TOTALYTD**: Calculates the year-to-date value.
- **SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR**: Compares current period with the same period in the previous year.

### Slide 7: **Filter Functions in DAX**
- **FILTER**: Returns a filtered table based on a condition.
- **ALL**: Ignores any applied filters on a column or table.
- **CALCULATE**: Modifies the filter context to change how values are calculated.

### Slide 8: **Aggregating Data in DAX**
- **SUMX**: Iterates over a table and sums the result of an expression.
- **AVERAGEX**: Calculates the average of an expression for each row of a table.
- **COUNTX**: Counts rows that satisfy a condition.

### Slide 9: **Row Context vs. Filter Context**
- **Row Context**: Refers to a row-by-row operation in calculated columns.
- **Filter Context**: Refers to the filters applied to data, impacting the results of measures.
- CALCULATE is used to modify the filter context.

### Slide 10: **Best Practices for Using DAX**
- Keep expressions simple and efficient.
- Use variables (`VAR`) to store intermediate results.
- Test complex calculations step by step.
- Always consider context (row and filter) when designing DAX formulas.
