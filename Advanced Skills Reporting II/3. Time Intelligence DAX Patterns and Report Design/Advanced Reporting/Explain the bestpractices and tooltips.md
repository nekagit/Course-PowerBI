### **Best Practices for Tooltips in Reports**

Tooltips are a great way to provide additional context to report viewers without cluttering the main visual. Here are some best practices for using tooltips effectively:

---

1. **Keep Tooltips Concise**  
   - Tooltips should provide **concise, to-the-point** information that enhances the understanding of a data point.
   - Avoid adding too much text or irrelevant details to avoid overwhelming the user.

2. **Use Relevant and Actionable Information**  
   - Include **important metrics** or details that directly relate to the data being viewed, such as totals, averages, or drill-down explanations.
   - Tooltips should offer information that adds value and context to what the user is seeing.

3. **Use Visual Cues in Tooltips**  
   - You can include **small visuals** like bar charts or icons within tooltips to convey information more effectively.
   - Keep it simple: a visual that supports the data without overcomplicating it.

4. **Customize Based on the Audience**  
   - Consider the **level of expertise** of your audience. If theyâ€™re non-technical users, keep tooltips simpler, with more explanatory text.
   - For advanced users, you might include **detailed calculations or in-depth insights**.

5. **Align Tooltips with Report Themes**  
   - Ensure tooltips are **consistent in design** with the overall report layout and visual style. Use the same fonts, colors, and sizing to create a cohesive look.

6. **Limit Information Overload**  
   - Too much data in a tooltip can lead to confusion. Provide **only what is necessary** to avoid distracting users from the primary visuals.
   
7. **Responsive to Interactions**  
   - Ensure tooltips work well on **both desktop and mobile** devices. On mobile, where space is limited, keep tooltips even more concise and make sure they are easy to trigger.

### **Best Practices for Using Tooltips in Power BI**
1. **Enable Custom Tooltips**  
   - Power BI allows you to design **custom report pages** specifically for tooltips. These can include visuals and data that are not in the main report view.

2. **Trigger Tooltips Only When Necessary**  
   - Configure tooltips to appear **on hover** or based on specific actions (click) to avoid distractions when not needed.

3. **Highlight Key Metrics**  
   - Power BI tooltips can show **additional measures** and **KPIs** not visible in the report. Use this feature to offer insights like variance, percentages, or additional context for a data point.

4. **Avoid Overloading with Complex Visuals**  
   - While Power BI allows using full visuals in tooltips, avoid overloading users with too many charts or tables. Keep the information focused and relevant. 

5. **Test Across Different Screen Sizes**  
   - Make sure the tooltip content is easy to read and interact with across different screen sizes and devices (especially mobile).
