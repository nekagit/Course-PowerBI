### Slide 1: **Introduction to Row-Level Security (RLS)**
- **Definition**: Row-Level Security (RLS) restricts data access at the row level, ensuring users only see data they are permitted to view.
- **Purpose**: Enhances data security by controlling which data subsets users can access based on roles or permissions.
- Essential for sensitive data protection, especially in multi-user environments.

### Slide 2: **Why Use Row-Level Security?**
- Protects confidential information, ensuring compliance with privacy laws.
- Reduces risk of data breaches by limiting access to relevant data.
- Enables personalized reports based on user roles (e.g., regional managers only see their regionâ€™s data).

### Slide 3: **How Row-Level Security Works**
- **Filters data rows**: Based on user identity or role, RLS applies filters to limit data access.
- Uses DAX expressions in Power BI or other tools to define rules for who sees what data.
- RLS rules can be static (hardcoded) or dynamic (based on user attributes).

### Slide 4: **Implementing Static Row-Level Security**
- **Static RLS**: User roles are predefined, with each role having specific access to a fixed subset of data.
- Example: Regional managers only see data from their assigned region.
- Roles and filters are manually assigned by the report creator.

### Slide 5: **Steps to Implement Static RLS in Power BI**
- Define roles in Power BI using the "Manage Roles" feature.
- Apply DAX filters to limit data visibility (e.g., `[Region] = "West"` for the West Region role).
- Test roles using "View as Role" to ensure correct data access for each user group.

### Slide 6: **Advantages and Limitations of Static RLS**
- **Advantages**: Simple to set up, ideal for reports with a fixed user base and straightforward access rules.
- **Limitations**: Requires manual role management, not scalable for large user bases with varying permissions.
- Adjusting static roles can be time-consuming if user access needs change frequently.

### Slide 7: **Implementing Dynamic Row-Level Security**
- **Dynamic RLS**: Data access is determined at runtime, based on user attributes (e.g., username, department, region).
- Uses DAX functions like `USERPRINCIPALNAME()` or `LOOKUPVALUE()` to dynamically filter data based on the current user.
- Ideal for large organizations with many users and complex access requirements.

### Slide 8: **Steps to Implement Dynamic RLS**
- Create a **security table** that maps users to roles or data access levels (e.g., user to region).
- Apply DAX filters that reference the security table to dynamically limit data based on the logged-in user.
- Example: `CALCULATE([Sales], FILTER(SecurityTable, SecurityTable[UserName] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()))`.

### Slide 9: **Advantages of Dynamic RLS**
- **Scalable**: Easily manages access for large numbers of users without manually creating multiple roles.
- Flexible: Adapts to changes in user roles and permissions without requiring manual updates to the report.
- Enables role-based access across various dimensions (e.g., region, department, project).

### Slide 10: **Best Practices for Row-Level Security**
- Always test RLS configurations thoroughly to avoid exposing sensitive data.
- Use a dedicated **security table** for dynamic RLS to centralize user access rules.
- Combine RLS with other security measures (e.g., data masking, column-level security) for enhanced protection.
- Monitor and audit RLS usage to ensure compliance and track data access.
