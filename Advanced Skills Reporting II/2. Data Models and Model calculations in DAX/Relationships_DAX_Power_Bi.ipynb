    "# Power BI: Essential Concepts and Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Understanding Relationships and Cardinality\n",
    "In Power BI, relationships are connections between tables that allow data to be linked across the model. Each relationship has a **cardinality** that defines how rows in one table relate to rows in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Cardinality\n",
    "1. **One-to-Many (1:*M*)**: The most common type, where one row in a \"dimension\" table (e.g., Customers) can relate to multiple rows in a \"fact\" table (e.g., Sales).\n",
    "2. **Many-to-One (M:*1*)**: Similar to One-to-Many but reversed in direction.\n",
    "3. **One-to-One (1:*1*)**: Each row in one table relates to exactly one row in another. Useful for linking tables with similar data, such as details and summary tables.\n",
    "4. **Many-to-Many (M:*M*)**: Used when both tables have repeated values. Power BI allows this with \"cross-filter\" settings, but it should be used cautiously to avoid performance issues and ambiguous relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Active vs. Inactive Relationships\n",
    "- **Active relationships** (solid lines in the model view) are used by default in calculations and visualizations.\n",
    "- **Inactive relationships** (dotted lines) can be activated in DAX formulas using the `USERELATIONSHIP` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship Properties\n",
    "- **Cross-filter direction**: Determines how filters propagate between tables. Options are *Single* (filters flow one way) and *Both* (bi-directional).\n",
    "- **Enforced Integrity**: Ensures that each related value exists in both tables. It's often enabled to improve query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Filter Propagation\n",
    "Filter propagation in Power BI refers to how filters applied to one table or visual can affect data in related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Filter Propagation\n",
    "- **Single Direction**: Filters flow from one table to another in a single direction, typically from dimension (lookup) to fact tables.\n",
    "- **Bi-directional (Both)**: Filters can flow in both directions between related tables. This is useful in many-to-many relationships but should be used cautiously to avoid ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Filter Context in Power BI\n",
    "- **Filter Context**: Determines the subset of data used for calculations based on applied filters, slicers, and relationships.\n",
    "- Filter context can be modified directly in DAX using functions like `CALCULATE`, which can add or remove filters for a specific calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Model Calculations Using DAX\n",
    "DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language for Power BI, used to create custom calculations in models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of DAX Calculations\n",
    "- **Calculated Columns**: Stored as part of the model. Good for adding custom fields to tables that need to be referenced in visualizations.\n",
    "- **Measures**: Calculations performed at query time. Ideal for aggregating data dynamically in visuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common DAX Functions\n",
    "- **SUM**: Adds up values in a column.\n",
    "- **AVERAGE**: Calculates the average of a column.\n",
    "- **COUNT**: Counts the number of rows in a table or non-empty values in a column.\n",
    "- **SUMX, AVERAGEX**: Iterates over a table to calculate values row by row.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Comprehending Dynamic Measures\n",
    "Dynamic measures in Power BI adjust based on user interactions, such as slicers, filters, or drill-downs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Dynamic Measures\n",
    "- **Time-Intelligence Measures**: Calculations like Year-to-Date, Month-to-Date, and Previous Year. Power BI has built-in DAX functions for these, like `TOTALYTD` and `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR`.\n",
    "- **Switching Measures with SELECTEDVALUE**: Allows users to switch between metrics based on slicer selection. For example:\n",
    "  ```DAX\n",
    "  SelectedMetric = \n",
    "      SWITCH( \n",
    "          SELECTEDVALUE('Metric'[Metric]), \n",
    "          \"Sales\", SUM(Sales[Amount]), \n",
    "          \"Profit\", SUM(Sales[Profit]), \n",
    "          \"Quantity\", SUM(Sales[Quantity]) \n",
    "      )\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for Creating Dynamic Measures\n",
    "1. **Use `IF` or `SWITCH`** statements to define different conditions based on selections.\n",
    "2. **Use `HASONEVALUE`** to check if only one item is selected, helping prevent calculation errors.\n",
    "3. **Avoid overusing dynamic measures** as they may impact performance in large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Use of the `CALCULATE` Function and Modifiers\n",
    "`CALCULATE` is one of the most powerful DAX functions. It changes the context in which calculations are evaluated, allowing for complex aggregations and conditional filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax of CALCULATE\n",
    "```DAX\n",
    "CALCULATE(<Expression>, <Filter1>, <Filter2>, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Expression**: The calculation to be modified.\n",
    "- **Filter1, Filter2, â€¦**: Conditions that modify the filter context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CALCULATE Modifiers\n",
    "1. **ALL**: Removes filters from specified columns or tables, useful for calculating totals or overriding specific filters.\n",
    "   ```DAX\n",
    "   TotalSales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), ALL(Sales))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **FILTER**: Applies a row-level filter to a table before calculating the expression.\n",
    "   ```DAX\n",
    "   HighValueSales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), FILTER(Sales, Sales[Amount] > 1000))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **ALLEXCEPT**: Removes filters from all columns except the specified ones.\n",
    "   ```DAX\n",
    "   SalesByRegion = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), ALLEXCEPT(Sales, Sales[Region]))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of CALCULATE in a Dynamic Measure\n",
    "The `CALCULATE` function allows you to build context-sensitive measures that respond to filters:\n",
    "```DAX\n",
    "TotalProfitForSpecificYear = CALCULATE(\n",
    "    SUM(Sales[Profit]), \n",
    "    'Date'[Year] = 2023\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `CALCULATE` filters the `Profit` calculation to only include records from 2023.\n"
